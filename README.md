The Knowhere is a binder clip connected to a Raspberry Pi. When you select the clip (by an inputted name) from the Pi, the clip begins making a noise allowing you to find it. Or in other words, it beeps. Loudly. And icing on the cake, it costs about two dollars to make with parts from wholesale electronic vendors, allowing you to flood your house with clips. That beep.

According to the FCC, Part 15 devices, such as this one are legal as long as the working range of the device is under 200 feet. If you're in the U.S. like we are, you should be good legally speaking as long as you make sure the radius only covers 200 feet AND is within the FM zone (88-108 Mhz). Some tips on good channels to use: Everything below 99.1 is used for licensed nonprofit low power broadcasts and should generally be clear unless you are within range of a religious institution or a school campus that is broadcasting. Our capacitors are tuned to 88.1 Mhz. Your mileage may vary.

If you are in another country, make sure to always follow your local laws, and if they permit, choose the appropriate channels.

Make this device at your own risk.

The FCC ruling on Unlicensed Low Power Transmitters such as ours is included in the links section. If you're planning to build this device please look at these rulings and the exact wording before you do so, just in case.
